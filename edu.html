                    Unemployment is not a new topic. It has been a problem for many years. 
                    But the pandemic has hit hard on people working on a paycheck-to-paycheck 
                    basis. COVID has created additional unique challenges to the employment 
                    sector (Venkatesh, 2020). The Lockdown during the pandemic affected 
                    low-income workers. A study indicates that up to one-third of United 
                    States jobs were vulnerable. And a majority of these jobs include jobs 
                    relating to food service, customer service, office support, and sales. 
                    Up to 86 percent of these jobs were paid less than $40,000 annually 
                    (Lund, Ellingrud, Hancock, Manyika, & Dua, 2020).

                    <p>
                        With the introduction of Google classroom, zoom, and google meet, 
                        students have changed their way of thinking and adapted to technology 
                        by uploading assignments, watching online lectures, and solving 
                        multiple-choice questions, which created the biggest change in regular 
                        academic sessions. College students have used the time to learn software 
                        courses such as MATLAB, R, Python, Java, and C programming. The 
                        postgraduate students have focused on NET, SET, GAT, and other competitive 
                        exams (Saima Firdaus & ShubhadaRamesh, 2021).

                    <h3><em>Teachers:</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Teachers were challenged to learn new technologies and teach those to students 
                        for better education. They had to learn new teaching methods using PPTs, videos, 
                        and conferencing using zoom, google meet or other applications. This way of teaching 
                        changed the relationship between students and teaching making it stronger and closer. 
                        To improve the teaching methods and help students get subjects to understand better, 
                        teachers had to attend online conferences, meetings, webinars, quizzes, and 
                        orientation courses (Saima Firdaus & ShubhadaRamesh, 2021).

                    <h3><em>Researchers:</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Faculty pursuing Ph.D. have gotten sufficient time for their research and study. 
                        Many researchers focused on and published their papers in various national and 
                        international journals. One of the fields where there were many publications during 
                        the pandemic is the medical field. Medical researchers worldwide have started studying 
                        and developing vaccines for COVID-19 (Saima Firdaus & ShubhadaRamesh, 2021).

                    <p>
                        The non-teaching staff is generally classified into two categories, 
                        clerk office staff, and peon. Typically, the office clerks and peons 
                        mostly spend their time in the office maintaining a clean environment 
                        and having enough time to focus on their health and wellbeing (Saima 
                        Firdaus & ShubhadaRamesh, 2021).
