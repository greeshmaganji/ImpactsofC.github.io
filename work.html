                        The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted students, teachers, researchers, 
                        and non-teaching staff in the Education sector. There have also been 
                        setbacks for academic centers and learning institutes (Kuhfeld, 2019). 
                        The pandemic has not only impacted many people but also introduced them 
                        to the new and latest technology.

                    <h3><em>Job Changes and Remote Work:</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        The nature of work had substantially changed for people who had 
                        sustainable jobs by working remotely. New technologies have been 
                        introduced for the connectivity of users across the world. In contrast 
                        to the general employees, some groups of employees more easily develop 
                        negative perceptions than positive ones, such as autistic employees, 
                        teachers, and university employees,due to the challenges of adaptation 
                        to teleworking. On top of that, strict management control and monitoring, 
                        deteriorated work engagement, and excessive job demand can aggravate 
                        employees' mental health and psychological symptoms during remote working 
                        <img class="left" src="assets/images/work2.png" alt="Impact of Covid 19 on work-from-home on healthcare workers" >
                        (Wei, Yingbo, & Danni, 2021). A study has proven that remote work has been 
                        effective and that people in the United States embrace flexibility. More 
                        than thirty-five percent of jobs offer full-time work from home, twenty- 
                        three percent of employers offer part-time work-from-home flexibility, 
                        whereas forty-two percent do not offer work-from-home flexibility as 
                        required by the job description (Andr√©, et al., 2022).

                    <h3><em>Job Outcomes:</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        The changes in employment will impact many employment outcomes beyond 
                        job performance, including organizational commitment, job stress, and 
                        job satisfaction. Increasing data suggest that important Organizational 
                        changes, particularly those aided by technology, have a big impact on the 
                        outcomes of jobs (Venkatesh, 2020). According to another research (Bariso, 
                        2020), jobs having more stress leads to less job satisfaction lead to lower 
                        job performance. Companies like Google, Cisco, and Amazon have an extra day 
                        off for their employees to relieve their stress and recharge. This method has 
                        been effective for employers and employees.
